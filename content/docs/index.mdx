description: Welcome to the Proactice documentation.

This is the documentation for the Proactice site.

I'm going to use this to document all the features of Proactice and how they are built. The documentation site is built using [ContentLayer](/docs/documentation/contentlayer) and MDX.

This site is a work in progress. If you see dummy text on a page, it means I'm still working on it. You can follow updates on Twitter [@gwengallon](https://twitter.com/gwengallon).
